# Emails Named Entity Recognition & Information Extraction project

This is a project I did for the NLP module. The program tags the named entities in emails from the database and calculates the accuaracy, error rate, precision of the tagging by comparing to the ground truth. The named entities include addresses, paragraphs, sentences, names, dates. The emails contain ambiguities and grammar problems.

The file is not able to run without properly configured.
